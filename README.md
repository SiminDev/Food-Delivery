# Food Delivery App

A simple demo of food delivery app using React, to practice working with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Redux-Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/).


## Description
This project is a simple React app for food delivery. It has two pages for selecting food from the menu and managing the cart.

My goal in this project was to show my design skills.

I designed the UI myself using [Figma](https://figma.com/) and inspired by some Dribbble designs.

It's my first experience with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and styling is done entirely using it.

I hope to responsive it for different screen sizes in the future.
