# Food Delivery App

This demo project illustrates the fusion of [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) CSS and [Redux-Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) in the context of a food delivery application. It offers a simple yet comprehensive example of how to build an appealing UI while effectively managing the application's state.

## UI Design

I personally designed the user interface using the [Figma](https://figma.com/) platform, drawing inspiration from various designs showcased on Dribbble. This endeavor marks my inaugural encounter with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), as the entirety of the styling was accomplished through its utilization./

See the comparison of the Figma design and the local website build in the image below.
